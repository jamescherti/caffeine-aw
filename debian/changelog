    xdg-screensaver (LP#1638042).
  * Make bold icons findable again under ubuntu-mono-dark theme
    (LP#1638233).

caffeine (2.9.0) xenial; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Use xdg-utils for xdg-screensaver instead of caffeine-screensaver.
  * Depend on python3-ewmh; ewmh.py is no longer packaged.

    ubuntu-mono-light theme.

    Freedesktop-registered desktops, other than legacy (Old).

caffeine (2.8.4) xenial; urgency=low

  * Ensure correct version of Gtk is loaded, fixing warning.
  * Fix #1434886: allow caffeine-indicator to show in any desktop
    environment's menu by removing the OnlyShowIn line. With the
    proliferation of DEs, this is not feasible to maintain.
  * Copy fixes and updates from Debian's debian/control file.

caffeine (2.8.3) trusty; urgency=low

  * Fix gir dependency on gtk: should be for gtk3, not gtk2. This didn't
    actually matter, since the correct dependency was brought in via
    appindicator, so really this change removes a bogus dependency.
  * Fix bug introduced in 2.8.1: Caffeine only worked once, and left
    orphan processes lying around and desktop idleness permanently
    inhibited (LP #1412083).

 -- Reuben Thomas <rrt@sc3d.org>  Tue, 20 Jan 2015 01:07:17 +0000

caffeine (2.8.2) trusty; urgency=low

  * Fix a nasty bug in caffeine-indicator introduced in 2.8.1.

 -- Reuben Thomas <rrt@sc3d.org>  Sat, 17 Jan 2015 00:41:04 +0000

caffeine (2.8.1) trusty; urgency=low

  * Add some missing dependencies (LP #1411648).
  * Fix handling of signals, especially Ctrl+C, which could result in
    orphan processes inhibiting desktop idleness.

 -- Reuben Thomas <rrt@sc3d.org>  Fri, 16 Jan 2015 23:11:30 +0000

caffeine (2.8) trusty; urgency=low

  * Use xdg-screensaver to control desktop idleness (LP #1266953).
  * Add caffeinate script to inhibit idleness for the duration of a
    command, and caffeine-indicator to allow manual toggling
    (LP #1321750).

 -- Reuben Thomas <rrt@sc3d.org>  Mon, 22 Dec 2014 23:07:50 +0000

caffeine (2.7.2) trusty; urgency=low

  * Fix a crash when there is no active window (LP# 1322291).
  * Fix Caffeine not terminating when the session ends (LP #1324304).

 -- Reuben Thomas <rrt@sc3d.org>  Mon, 19 May 2014 18:21:22 +0100

caffeine (2.7.1) trusty; urgency=low

  * Fix a crash when a window disappears during full-screen check.

 -- Reuben Thomas <rrt@sc3d.org>  Mon, 19 May 2014 18:21:22 +0100

caffeine (2.7) trusty; urgency=low

  * Remove manual control, and hence UI.
  * Allow multiple instances per user: should really be one per X
    display.

 -- Reuben Thomas <rrt@sc3d.org>  Thu, 15 May 2014 13:25:50 +0100

caffeine (2.6.2) saucy; urgency=low

  * Add a build number just to persuade Launchpad to rebuild.

 -- Reuben Thomas <rrt@sc3d.org>  Tue, 25 Feb 2014 23:13:15 +0000

caffeine (2.6) saucy; urgency=low

  * Auto-activate the screensaver when a full-screen window is present.
  * Remove the ability to watch processes; applications should inhibit
    idleness themselves, and many now do.
  * Remove -a and -d command-line arguments: single-instance
    nature of Caffeine means it shouldn't be used from the command
    line. xdg-screensaver should be used instead.
  * Bump to standards 3.9.5 (no change).

 -- Reuben Thomas <rrt@sc3d.org>  Thu, 30 Jan 2014 23:13:15 +0000
